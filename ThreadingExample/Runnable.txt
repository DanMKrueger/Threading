Create a class that implements the Runnable interface. Inside the run method:
    Create a print statement that says "Started" along with the current thread id.
    Create a loop that prints the numbers 1-10 along with the current thread id.
    After ending the loop write a print statement that says "finished printing" along with the current thread id.
    In the main class instantiate two threads and pass in the class you created.
    Run the threads.
